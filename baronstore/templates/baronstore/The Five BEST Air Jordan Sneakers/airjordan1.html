                            <h2>The Air jordan 1</h2>
                            <p class="excert">
                                the
                                Jordan one is an interesting sneaker to
                                judge it kind of jumped all over the
                                place at one point I had them at number
                                three I even had them as low as number
                                five but at the end of the day after a
                                lot of deliberation I just think this is
                                the best Air Jordan sneaker it is easily
                                the most popular Air Jordan of all time
                                and without the Air Jordan one the
                                Jordan Line might not be what we know it
                                today we all know the story about the
                                NBA banning the black and red Jordan
                                ones because they didn't comply with the
                                uniform regulations at the time even
                                though it was actually the Nike airship
                                that was banned but little did they know
                                that fine created in aura around Jordan
                                sneakers which put them in high demand
                                with the fans and the momentum from the
                                marketing campaign that took advantage
                                of the band carried on into the next
                                shoe and the next one and the one after
                                that and so on and so forth while the
                                ones are basically a slimmer version of
                                the already popular Nike Dunk and
                                technically they aren't the most unique
                                looking Jordan out of the bunch they are
                                still the most worn Jordan in the entire
                                line
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                thanks to their simple classic and
                                accessible look which has never gotten
                                old throughout the decades and has
                                remained alive thanks to the love of OG
                                colorways as well as the new ones
                                arguably has the best nan og colorway
                                lineup in the entire series with a
                                myriad of collaborations and collections
                                that are available in pretty much any
                                color you can imagine making the ones
                                easily the most collectible Jordan of
                                all time since the new colorways of the
                                silhouette are dropping what seems like
                                every single month providing fans with
                                anything their heart desires
                                now as for relevancy on the court I mean
                                MJ said it in the last dance himself
                                right shoe technology has definitely
                                surpassed what the ones originally did
                                in 86 however that is not stopping
                                anyone including Michael himself from
                                rocking the ones as a classic piece of
                                footwear that is so nostalgic it almost
                                makes worth bleeding from your feet to
                                wear them an MSD for one last time no
                                matter the color no matter the material
                                the Air Jordan 1 looks good no matter
                                how you dress them up so while the ones
                                haven't aged the best on the court
                                they're off court appeal is at an
                                all-time high and it isn't going down
                                anytime soon because the ones reputation
                                is the most versatile model in the air
                                Jordan line is unassailable and that is
                                why i have them at the number one spot
                                as the consummate Air Jordan sneaker
                                that is essential in every secret
                                collection no matter the size I can go
                                to bed tonight with a good conscience
                                saying that the Air Jordan one is the
                                best Air Jordan sneaker ever and if I
                                can only rock one pair of j's in my
                                entire life I mean I think it would
                                probably be the ones.
