                            <h2>The Air Jordan Floors</h2>
                            <p class="excert">
                                like I said earlier the fours are often
                                regarded as a refined version of the
                                three since they have many of the same
                                features as its predecessor but also
                                have an overall slimmer build as well as
                                additional features such as the wings
                                which give the silhouette more depth and
                                layers so while the threes are no doubt
                                the more groundbreaking sneaker in the
                                industry and they definitely shook up
                                the sneaker world the force took with
                                the threes did and did it better, the
                                 fours  were slimmer lighter and when
                                compared to the more luxurious nature of
                                the threes the fours just felt more
                                sporty which made them more accessible
                                as in everyday pair of shoes that you
                                could wear anytime such as on a hot
                                summer day in New York City designer
                                Tinker Hatfield wanted to dive deeper
                                into performance with the fours as
                                opposed to the previous three models
                                which were heavily inspired by fashion
                                and teacher did this by dipping the mesh
                                on the mid-foot and soft plastic and
                                blew air through it to clear out the
                                plastic in between making the mesh panel
                                feel not as cheap as it would without it
                                the results were a more aggressive model
                                that fell into the sports footwear genre
                                even more as opposed to blurring the
                                line between sportswear and fashion like
                                the Jordan two and three did and in
                                effect the fours actually became fashion
                                and forced that world to lean more into
                                the sportswear genre as opposed to
                                sportswear trying to be designed to fit
                                in with fashion as for iconic moments
                                MJ hit what is arguably his first
                                real iconic shot in the NBA in the fours
                                with the shot over ello in Cleveland
                                during the 89 Eastern Conference Center
                                mania in full gear and making even more
                                fans want to be like Mike.

                                The fours are also one of the more sought-after retros
                                in the entire series with pretty much
                                every colorway from the OG white cement
                                and Brad's to the newer metallic purple
                                selling out on-site which not only makes it,
                                the floor is extremely popular but also
                                kind of exclusive to those who have a
                                pair since you have to try relative
                                hard to obtain them whether they're
                                older new it really doesn't matter
                                people love them a pair of fours and
                                that's why I think they're the third
                                best air Jordan sneaker of all time and
                                also because this was actually the first
                                sneaker that I ever camped out for so
                                they'll always hold a special place in
                                my heart but I know some of you guys for
                                whatever reason don't like the four so
                                let me know where you have them ranked
                                on your list down below all right now it
                                is finally that time to decide which of
                                these two is the most iconic Air Jordan
                                sneaker of all time the best of the best
                                the crème de la crème the number one
                                undisputed champ it is between
